# Aptwe

A well typed by construction kernel language for bidirectional programming, implemented in Idris2

Inspired by Idris being named after [a cartoon dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_the_Engine#Idris_the_Dragon), Aptwe (pronounced "aptee") is named after the [Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Psychic_Tandem_War_Elephant?file=Ancient_Psychic_Tandem_War_Elephant.png), a minor character in Adventure Time. It doesn't matter that this is a terrible name, because it is only a kernel language and will never be programmer-facing.
